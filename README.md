# Driver_behaviour
In this app, we have used three sensors, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer available in a smartphone to monitor the safe and unsafe acceleration and deceleration, right and left turn and lane changes. We have also used various other contributing factors such as speed, harsh brakes, weather conditions and safety condition of the road. We have implemented an algorithm to determine the score of the driver ranging from 0-10 and we have designed an android application to interact with the user to show the driver score, safe and unsafe drivers nearby and to provide feedback to the driver on unsafe events.
